// Q.4: Create integer variable assign any year to it and check if a year is leap year or not.
// If a year is divisible by 4 then it is leap year but if the year is century year like 2000, 1900, 2100 then it must be divisible by 400.
// i.e: Use % ( modulus ) operator.

// Q.5  Write a program to read temperature in centigrade and display a suitable message according to temperature:
// You have num variable temperature = 42;
// Now print the message according to temperature:
// temp < 0 then Freezing weather
// temp 0-10 then Very Cold weather
// temp 10-20 then Cold weather
// temp 20-30 then Normal in Temp
// temp 30-40 then Its Hot
// temp >=40 then Its Very Hot


// A.5:

// Q.6 Write a Dart program that prompts the user to input their age. Based on their age,

// Q.7 Create a Dart program that acts as a basic ATM machine. Ask the user

// Q.8 : Create a list of names and print all names using list.


  // Step 1: Create a list of names
  List<String> names = ["Arham", "Khalil", "Anis", "Owais", "Shahjhan"];

  // Step 2: Print all names using a loop
  print("List of Names:");
